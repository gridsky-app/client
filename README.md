**gridsky-app/client** is the main repository of Gridsky, currently being reworked and improved.

The code is shared to support collaboration and transparency as the project evolves. While it’s not open source in the traditional sense, the license allows for contributions and involvement — just not wholesale cloning or rebranding. The more the community engages, the more open it may become over time.
